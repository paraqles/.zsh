The goal of this configuration attempt, is to provide a flexibel and clean
configuration for the _zsh_ shell.

### There has a lot of work to be done; ###

- Build a theme system, flexibel enough to provide a way for plugins to add
  custom parts to the prompt.

- Alias binding checks

- Functions for convienance

- Make zsh recognize changes in the $PATH dirs

and much more.

### Whats working until now: ###

- Loading of plugins in their own repository.

- Setting of options through an array
